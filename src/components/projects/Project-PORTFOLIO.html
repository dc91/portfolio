    This portfolio is a collection of my projects, showcasing my skills and personality. 
    The portfolio is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, 
    making it easy for potential employers or clients to navigate and view my work.
    I have worked hard to make the site work on all devices,
    and I am proud of the responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
    Especially since I love using vanilla JavaScript and CSS to create beautiful and functional websites.
    I have grown fond of Astro for building static sites, which is why I used it here.
